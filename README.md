Just solvin' some LeetCode problems on the side in the best language in the
world (fight me). Hopefully learning some DSA along the way!

A
[fetcher module](https://github.com/BenDeJonge/rust-leetcode/tree/main/src/fetcher)
is available to make web requests to LeetCode to automatically pull in question
data and create local resources.

```
$ cargo run fetch <problem-name>
```

Here, the problem name can be obtained from the URL:
`https://leetcode.com/problems/<problem-name>/`. Typically, this is simply the
title in lowercase with spaces replaced by dashes.
